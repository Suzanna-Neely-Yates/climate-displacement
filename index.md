# ECG Heartrate Categorization

## Introduction
Patterns in heart rate activity in the heat of the moment can be the difference between life and death. Knowing that you have abnormal heart activity and that you need to seek help quickly could be a life saver. Using existing ECG heartrate readings of normal heartrate activity as well as abnormal activity, neural networks could be utilized to predict possible dangerous levels of heart activity before it is too late. Implementation of this in everyday devices that can measure heart rate, such as smartwatches, phones, and other devices could be very useful.

## Project Description
The focus will be on training neural network(s) in order to classify ECG readings as either normal or abnormal. The NN would be given a training dataset from existing images or ECG files, that are labelled as such (normal or abnormal). From that, the NN would figure out patterns that help it classify the readings that it would be given by a capable device (smartwatch, phone, etc) regularly.

The NN would be ideally deployed as an application or feature on said devices, and seeing how it would work. In the long term, we would try to fine tune the training data to minimize the loss function as much as possible.

## Project Goals
1. Train a NN for ECG heartbeat classification using existing datasets
2. Minimize loss function and fine tune classification
3. Implement/deploy as application on watch/phone
